SERIAL COMMANDS
"zenith <abs deg>" : sets zenith angle and moves rotational stage (90deg on the zaber stage is 0deg)
"xoffset <delta mm>": set the center x position. offsets from starting point and moves there
"yoffset <delta mm>": set the center y position. offsets from starting point and moves there
"origin" : moves stages to origin, should be used prior to setting xoffset and yoffset
"start" : starts moving the x-axis and zenith angle between +/- 60 deg
"stop" : stops the movement


<abs unit>: floating point number of the absolute postion in unit units
<delta unit>: floating point number of the relative position in unit units
